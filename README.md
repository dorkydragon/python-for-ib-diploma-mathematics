# IB Diploma Mathematics Toolkits with Jupyter Notebook

# Introduction

List of articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@shinichiokada). 

The new IB Diploma Mathematics syllabus introduced a new component called "toolkit". Total time allocation for this component is 30 hours for SL and HL. In the syllabus outline, it reads:

> Toolkit gives students opportunities in the classroom for undertaking
> an inquiry-based approach and focusing on conceptual understanding

> - IB Mathematics: application and interpretation guide

In this series, I am going to explore the possibilities what Jupyter Notebook can offer to the IB Diploma Mathematics teachers and students. We are going to use Jupyter Notebook.

> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text... - jupyter.org

We are going to install Anaconda since it includes Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries. Python has rich and mature libraries suitable for IB Mathematics. Python is a programming language and currently [it became the language of choice for Data Science.](https://www.netguru.com/blog/how-did-pytho-become-the-language-of-choice-for-data-science)
