# IB Diploma Mathematics Toolkits with Jupyter Notebook

# Introduction

This is a list of articles I wrote in [Medium](https://medium.com/@shinichiokada). 

The new IB Diploma Mathematics syllabus introduced a new component called "toolkit". Total time allocation for this component is 30 hours for SL and HL. In the syllabus outline, it reads:

> Toolkit gives students opportunities in the classroom for undertaking
> an inquiry-based approach and focusing on conceptual understanding 
> of the conten...
> - IB Mathematics: application and interpretation guide

In this series, I am going to explore the possibilities what Jupyter Notebook can offer to the IB Diploma Mathematics teachers and students. We are going to use Jupyter Notebook.

> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text... - jupyter.org

We are going to install Anaconda since it includes Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries. Python has rich and mature libraries suitable for IB Mathematics. Python is a programming language and currently [it became the language of choice for Data Science.](https://www.netguru.com/blog/how-did-python-become-the-language-of-choice-for-data-science)


# Topics

Some topics are already written and some are not. I will update this article regularly.

At the moment I am forcusing on Statistics and the following is the list from IB Diploma Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide.

- [Descriptive statistics including, histograms,  mean, median, mode, interquartile range, percentiles, standard deviation, variance, range, box and whisker diagram](http://bit.ly/2S1yHIm).

- [Linear correlation of bivariate data. Scatter diagrams including lines of best fit. Equation of the regression line](http://bit.ly/2Pdv6Fj)

- [Spearman's rank correlation](http://bit.ly/2YHF5G8)

- [Chi square goodness of fit test](http://bit.ly/349FsKF)

- [Chi-square Independence Test and The t-test](http://bit.ly/2EaqgST).

- Probability

- Venn diagrams, tree diagrams, sample space diagrams. Combined events. Mutually exclusive events. Conditional probability. Independent events.

- Discrete random variables and probability distributions. Expected value.

- Binomial distribution. 

- Normal distribution

- Reliability tests. Validity tests.

- Least squares regression, square residuals, the coefficient of determination.

- Linear transformation. Expected value of linear combinations of n random variables. Unbiased estimate.

- Central limit theorem

- Confidence intervals for the mean of a normal population

- Poisson distribution

- Test for population mean for normal and Poisson distribution. Population product moment correlation. Type I and II errors.

- Transition matrices. Regular Markov chains. Steady state and long-term probabilities.
